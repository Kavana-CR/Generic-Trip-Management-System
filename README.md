<h2> Generic Trip Management System </h2>
<p>Group size: 4 <br> <br>
The goal was to develop a data model that could be used appropriately for REDIS. Data Models were developed for ever changing volatile data such as traffic updates, public transportation which included bookings, seat reservations and delay notifications, hotel reservations, city based events. The aim was to provide information to users on the fly.</p> <br>
